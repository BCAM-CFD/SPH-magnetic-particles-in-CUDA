# SPH magnetic particles in CUDA
SPH for Newtonian fluids with wall boundaries and suspensions of spherical magnetic particles, implemented in CUDA.

Developed by Adolfo Vázquez-Quesada.

--------------------------------------------------

- Host variables and functions are declared in class_system.h.
  Each function is defined in its own file, specifically in system_* files.

- Device variables and functions are declared in kernel_functions.h.
  Each function is defined in its own file, specifically in kernel_* files.

- In config.h we can define if the real variables are float or double.

- main.cu is the main file of the code.

To restart a simulation
*****************************
1.- Use the same input file of the initial simulation (or some variation of it).

2.- In the input file: new_sim 1

3.- Create a file 'input_particles.in' with the following columns:

        --- 2D --
		
	   1.- x
	   
	   2.- y
	   
	   3.- Vel x
	   
	   4.- Vel y
	   
	   5.- mass
	   
	   6.- type of particle
	   
       --- 3D --
	   
	   1.- x
	   
	   2.- y
	   
	   3.- z	
	   
	   4.- Vel x
	   
	   5.- Vel y
	   
	   6.- Vel z
	   
	   7.- mass
	   8.- type of particle
4.- Run the simulation
